###Definition###

1. **Instance Variables** (**Non-Static** Fields): a field declared without the 
static modifier. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables because 
their values are unique to each instance of a class (to each object, in other words); 
- e.g. currentSpeed of one bicycle is independent from the currentSpeed of another.

2. **Class Variables** (**Static** Fields): a field declared with the static modifier; 
this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in 
existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated. 
- e.g. A field defining the number of gears for a particular kind of bicycle 
could be marked as **static** since conceptually the same number of gears will 
apply to all instances. The code ```static int numGears = 6;``` would create such 
a static field. Additionally, the keyword ```final``` could be added to indicate 
that the number of gears will never change.

3. **Local Variables**: a method will often store its temporary state in local 
variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is e.g. ```int count = 0;```. 
There is no special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination 
comes entirely from the location in which the variable is declared â€” inside a method.
Hence, local variables are only visible to the methods in which they are declared; 
they are not accessible from the rest of the class.

4. **Parameters**: parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields". 
This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well (such as constructors 
and exception handlers)

##Naming##
Convention: for constant variables - ```static final int NUM_GEARS = 6;```

##Primitive Data Types (7 in total)##
- byte: 8-bit, 1 byte, -128~127
- short: 16-bit, 2 bytes, -32,768~32,767
- int: 32-bit, 4 bytes, -2^31~2^31-1
- long: 64-bit, 8 bytes, -2^63~2^63-1
```compareUnsigned```, ```divideUnsigned``` etc are in Integer class and Long 
class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers.

- float: 32-bit, 4 bytes
- double, 64-bit, 8 bytes
Never use these for precise values (currency). Use java.math.BigDecimal class instead.

- boolean, 1-bit
- char, 16-bit, 2 bytes, '\u0000' (or 0) ~ '\uffff' (or 65,535)

Default values are **0** or **NULL** or **false**.

Local variables are slightly different; the compiler never assigns a default value to an uninitialized local variable. If you cannot initialize your local variable where it is declared, make sure to assign it a value before you attempt to use it. Accessing an uninitialized local variable will result in a compile-time error.


a few special escape sequences for char and String literals: \b (backspace), \t (tab), \n (line feed), \f (form feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quote), \' (single quote), and \\ (backslash).
